# CodeLibrary

As people step into the world of coding, often times, there are random scenarios and problems that people run into that leave people befuddled. 

The hope with this code library is to be a place to find generic codes, strange logic problems, and quick explanations for new languages that people can use to read, learn, and use!



### What the Files are:

1) Random generic functions that you can pull out and use for various scenarios (I) 
[Randomfunc.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/Randomfunc.js)
2) A logic JS that I ran into, hopefully adding more [logic.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/logic.js)
3) Key differences between ES5 and ES6 [ES6.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/ES6_logic.js)
4) Javascript conundrums and Gotcha codes filled with the best puns [JS-Gotcha.js](https://github.com/juhuyoon/codeLibrary/blob/master/JS-Gotchas.js)
